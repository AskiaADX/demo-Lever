# demo-Lever

Set of modern toggles for single &amp; multiple questions.

HTML / CSS only. Will not be supported on IE.

Note: avoid odd values for root `font-size`. Currently set to `18px`. Try to limit to only even values to avoid input misalignment in webkit-based browsers.

Demo [available here](https://askiaadx.github.io/demo-Lever/).
